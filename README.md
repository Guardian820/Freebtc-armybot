# Freebtc-armybot
The purpose of this repository is for educational purposes only, I wanted to make an efficient loop using pure javascript, there is always something to improve, but for now the result is satisfactory. I've been trying to develop a private use bot for freebtc website. Anyway, this is just a prototype that took about 3+ hours of development. The code is just an idea, it's functional, but you will need to adapt a few lines of code if you want to play MULTIPLY BTC, feel free to use the code in your projects.  It's always good to remember that I exempt myself from any possible "damage" you cause to website owners using this code, so only use this if you really know what you're doing.
